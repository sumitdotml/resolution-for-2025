# 2025 Resolutions

## Target Setting

### 1. ML and personal growth through self-learning

I believe that there may be a lot of resources below that may be slightly unnecessary, or maybe I am missing some resources that I need to pursue. Basically, what I want from 2025 is to be:

- really good at Python
- really good at traditional ML
- really good at ML Math
- really good at PyTorch and NumPy
- good/okay-ish at ML Systems (the engineering side)
- good/okay-ish at C++ (I don't know anything about it)
- good at reading and implementing papers
- just become a solid ML practitioner in general

I'm not sure how to exactly describe the kind of role this entails, and maybe some of these are not as important as the rest. I just want to be a really good ML practitioner -- a mixture of someone who can do ML engineering, Deep Learning (NN, architecutures, etc.), NLP, and whatever it is that I may end up liking within the sphere of ML. However, I also do not want to do things with diminishing returns (or things that won't matter as much as some other aspects) since the time I have is quite limited (full-time job does not help much). Need insights from industry leaders, experts, and basically people who know way more than me (cries)

In any case, I built the following list for now.

---

#### Strong Python Skills

> [!IMPORTANT]
> First Half of 2025

Currently, I am okay in Python, but this is not going to be enough. I need to reach ***an advanced level*** in this language. For that, I can always add or subtract resources but currently I have:

1. [Practical Python](https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python) **~40 hours**. This should be done **as soon as possible**, hopefully by the end of _February_. 
2. [Advanced Python Mastery](https://github.com/dabeaz-course/python-mastery) -> **~50 hours**. This should be done by the end of the 1st half of 2024 (end of _June_).

Could add some more, but this is what I have for now. Maybe this is enough, honestly.

#### Complete the LLM from Scratch Book

> [!IMPORTANT]
> First Half of 2025

**Hopefully** by the end of ***January***.

Need to throughly understand everything there. Needs a lot of revision at the moment. I also need to do the additional materials (LoRA, etc.).

---

#### Complete the Math for ML Course on Math Academy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> First Half of 2025

**Hopefully** by the end of ***February***.

---

#### Clearly learn NumPy + Math in NumPy through Pablo's Blog

> [!IMPORTANT]
> First Half of 2025

[Blog Link](https://pabloinsente.github.io/intro-linear-algebra)

For this, I may also need to regularly refer to the numpy documentation, but that's the exact point! Should be pretty good.

---

#### Get to an intermediate level in PyTorch

> [!IMPORTANT]
> First Half of 2025

Should be done with this by the end of ***February***.

1. [Zero to Mastery PyTorch Book](https://www.learnpytorch.io/)

May need to add more resources. Should ask people on Twitter after I'm done with this.

However, I think I can learn this by doing things most likely (by just implementing papers, etc.). Let's see. But I will complete this PyTorch book regardless.

----------

#### Complete the ML with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn Book

> [!IMPORTANT]
> First Half of 2025

**Hopefully** by the end of ***June***.

----------

#### Projects - 1st Half of 2025

> [!IMPORTANT]
> First Half of 2025

1. Build a translation project through the things I've learned
2. Some RAG stuff
...

Add more. I should do different kinds of them to reinforce my skills. _Point to note_ here is that this isn't quite the ML Engineering here yet; that will be later this year.

**Aiming** to complete at least 4 projects by the end of ***June***.

----------

#### Start Reading & Implementing Papers - Hopefully 1 Paper Each Month

> [!IMPORTANT]
> First Half of 2025\
> Second Half of 2025

Only start this after you're done with the objectives till the end of ***February***.

**Aiming** to read & reimplement hopefully 10 papers this year.

----------

#### Complete all the Deep-ML questions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> First Half of 2025\
> Second Half of 2025

This is like leetcode but for ML, and there are 88 questions there as of today. Aim is to complete them all.

**Aiming** to solve 1-2 questions each week, starting ***March***.

---

#### Start the ML Engineering Journey

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Second Half of 2025

1. Get the basics down first:
    - [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning in Production](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-in-production/)

2. Read the __Designing ML Systems__ book by Chip Huyen.
3. From Ray Yoo:
    - **dissect how big real world companies are designing their ML systems (blog posts usually)**.
    - [Pinterest ML Blog in Medium](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/tagged/machine-learning)

4. Ask yourself relevant questions regarding ML Engineering:
    - Do you understand the deployment process in production?
    - ... add more. Need to ask people too.

----------

#### Projects - 2nd Half of 2025

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Second Half of 2025

1. Build 1-2 full-stack application to understand front-end, backend, database, and deployment properly. could integrate this for any of the projects in AI, actually.

2. Do at least 1 project showcasing designing, implementing, and maintaining ML pipelines if possible. or at least have some proof that showcases my ML pipeline knowledge --> reference can be the ML System book by Chip Huyen.

3. Start writing blogs on the papers you've read, and also on the projects you do.

add some more if things come to mind.

----------

#### Start Learning C++

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Second Half of 2025

This is something important for ML in general (DL, CUDA, etc.), and I've also always wanted to learn it anyway. This is the perfect time.

Resources? Ask people on Twitter.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Reach a point where you can do basic ML stuff with C++ (writing and training a simple MLP, building an autograd engine in C, __add more__).

----------

#### Start Looking for Some Research (or publication) Experience

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Second Half of 2025

I have literally no idea how to do this, but this is worth starting to consider this year. I have to do something about this! Ask people around, search for ideas and resources, etc.

---

#### So this is who I want to become this year

- really good at Python
- really good at traditional ML
- really good at ML Math
- good at PyTorch and NumPy
- okay at ML Systems
- okay-ish at C++
- okay-ish at reading and implementing papers

---

### 2. Job (not current work)

> Hopefully will get a ML job by the end of this year (aiming for within my company).

---

### 3. Grad School

Not entirely sure if this is even needed at this point to be honest, but maybe the Georgia Tech master's if I really wanna apply.
